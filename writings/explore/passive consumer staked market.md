Analysis paralysis is a real issue a lot of people are facing. Often also people simply don't know what they need. We propose a solution that reverses the current consumer and provider interactions, and in some sense goes back to the roots of trading.

In our system, a customer can issue any query to a chat bot. Language system automatically tags the query with trade categories and other metadata. For repeated consumers, other data is tracked. The app also allows to specify users location and other metadata. All of that data is fed into a system that creates a biddable item in a global consumer query ledger.

Providers of goods and services can subscribe to that ledger based on tags for their business and other metadata, such as location. They can bid on satisfying that query. A short timed auction is held and the highest bid can take over the chatbot and make their offer to the consumer.

If the consumer is not satisfied, the process reiterates however many times, until the consumer receives a good offer or decides to retreat.

Query subscribers are also allowed to add other tags and metadata to the consumer or their queries, both global or private to help the overall process.

On this system, the providers are incentivized to make the best offers first try, and based on game theory only the most motivated providers will bid for offers. 

Under this system the consumers can now potentially find the solution outside of their original framing of the problem and overall are more likely to end up with purchases than in a traditional consumer system where they have to painstakingly look for what they think they need.

User Experience: only one winning bid comes to the chat at a time. While looking for a winner, user can interact with the bot to further specify their wants, or simply wait for the outcome.

Quality Control: market mechanics and game theory will automatically balance bad providers out of the system - they will either loose too much money on bids, or not be able to outbid more dedicated parties, and they will still suffer from bad reviews and such, if their bid is shown to the user.

Trust and Adoption: this can be easily solved with transparent bidding (which the user can observe but is not forced to for simplicity), and the bidding board is visible to all bidders.

What is particularly innovative about such system is that providers can now potentially make offers proactively to a unique query, not simply display a set of offers, globally.
